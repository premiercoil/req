Project requirements system

This project is a framework for requirements development and tracking.
It is meant to showcase how a version-control system can aid in defining and implementing requirements to drive a project.

A good requirements system will greatly improve accountability at all levels in all directions.
This allows for realistic metering of expectations by all parties involved in a project.
It also greatly enhances the ability to forecast dates and outcomes.
