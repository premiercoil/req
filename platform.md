# Requirements Platform

The platform that enables good requirements and project documentation ought to have these features:
* Version Control
* Visibility with Access Control
* Facilities for discussion
* Ability to track related information

## Version Control

Modern version control systems automatically track changes to a repository.
They also allow users to go back and look at this history of changes.
In addition, they allow for parallel _branches_ of a project to be maintained which provides a means to:
- test unintrusive changes
- maintain minor variations of a project than can be merged at a later date

## Visibility & Access Control

Requirements and documentation should be visible to all stakeholders.
The requirements system should allow anyone to propose changes without disrupting the project.

## Discussion

There needs to be a way for stakeholders to present ideas for discussion.
This forum needs to be tied to the project and be permanently available for future reference.

## Info

The wiki-style portal for information allows project maintainers to easily provide information that supplements the main documentation.
This may include a glossary of terms, identification of stakeholders, and links to external sources.
